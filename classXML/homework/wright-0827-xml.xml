    <meta>[Letter from Marian Baldwin, June 30, 1917]</meta>

    <head>On Board La Touraine, </head>
    <head info="dateline">June 30th, 1917.</head>
    <para>Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off to
            <location type="country" context="incoming">France</location> and, for the first time in
        my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the <namedppl
            amount="group">American Fund for French Wounded</namedppl> found an opening for me in
            <location type="city" context="incoming">Paris</location> that I suppose I am still
        somewhat dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that
        I can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had
        a bit of a taste in <location type="city" context="past">New York</location> of the work
        that the <namedppl amount="group">A. F. F. W.</namedppl> is doing but its Headquarters in
            <location type="city" context="incoming">Paris</location> will be different in some ways
        I fancy.</para>

    <para>I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my age
        are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on my
        great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.</para>

    <para>As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing alongside, I
        know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many of
        this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one spoke much, and,
        little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after another appeared. I knew
        that you would be looking at those same stars down in <location type="city"
            >Lakewood</location> and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that filled my
        heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</para>

    <para>We waited near the <location type="landmark" context="past">Statue of Liberty</location>
        until midnight—a rumor had it that a "personage" was to come on board. This individual was
        shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had
        clambered aboard in the night was none other than the <namedppl amount="group">Italian
            Mission</namedppl>. Our spirits rose at once for, what with <namedppl amount="ind">Frank
            Sayre</namedppl> on the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall
        doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but
        two destroyers following us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one
        on each side, and seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war.
        A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or five
        days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!</para>

    <para>I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of
            <location type="country" context="origin">Haiti</location>, voluble and very portly—has
        four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother
        Hubbard and smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like incense! When I appeared, there
        didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am small, and I was soon
        tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! She really isn't bad and after looking me
        over carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed
        upon me! She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the French since the
        beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having lost some fingers off
        each hand. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers. </para>
