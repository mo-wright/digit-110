            <info>This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged to a
                student in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth century. The pastry
                school was owned by Edward Kidder, who taught at a few locations in London between
                around 1720 and 1734. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been used by
                students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder also published his recipes in
                the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.</info>

            <comment>If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We added the
                    <ing>cinnamon</ing> because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it
                rounded out the <ing>mace</ing> nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are
                great with tea. We rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it
                was too soft and stick to roll out, but a little bit more <ing>flour</ing> and a
                stint in the fridge might make the dough easier to work with a rolling
                pin.</comment>
