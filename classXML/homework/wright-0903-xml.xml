        <line><title>Cornflake Girl</title> Lyrics</line>
        <trivia>Tori Amos was in a 1987 commercial for Kellogg’s Just Right, which had cornflakes
            and raisins in it. Her label, Atlantic, later released Cornflakes boxes with Amos’s
            picture on them, which are now collectibles.</trivia>
